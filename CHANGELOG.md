# Changelog

**Release Date:** 2017-02-20

- Added support for Project-level settings.

## 1.3.1

**Release Date:** 2017-02-19

- Added support for the modified `trailingComma` option. The `trailingComma`
  option controls the printing of trailing commas wherever possible.
  
	Valid options are:
   
	* `"none"` - No trailing commas
	* `"es5"`  - Trailing commas where valid in ES5 (objects, arrays, etc)
	* `"all"`  - Trailing commas wherever possible (function arguments)

## 1.3.0

**Release Date:** 2017-02-18

- Added the new setting `allow_inline_formatting` (defaults to *false*) which
  provides the ability to format *selections* of in-lined JavaScript code,
  outside of the normal JavaScript syntax. For example, to format a selection of
  JavaScript code within a PHP or HTML file. When `true`, the JsPrettier command
  is available for use across all Sublime Text syntaxes.

## 1.2.5

**Release Date:** 2017-02-16

- Added format on save support for .jsx files.

## 1.2.4

**Release Date:** 2017-02-16

- Added support for the new `jsxBracketSameLine` option. When
  `jsxBracketSameLine` is *true* (the default is *false*), right-angle brackets
  `>` of multi-line jsx elements will be placed at the end of the last line,
  instead of being alone on the next line. You may be required to update to the
  latest version of the [Prettier] to leverage the `jsxBracketSameLine` option
  (available since v0.17.0).

## 1.2.0

**Release Date:** 2017-02-10

- Now when the `auto_format_on_save` setting is set to `true`, the entire file
  will always be formatted.
- Remove extra line-breaks injected by the `prettier` cli command at the end of
  selected regions and entire file.
- Added Context Menu shortcut.

  `JsPrettier.sublime-settings` file.

## 1.1.1

**Release Date:** 2017-01-22

- Introduced less aggressive error reporting ([#4]). Errors generated by the
  `prettier` cli are written to Sublime Text's console output window, instead of
  an alert dialog.
